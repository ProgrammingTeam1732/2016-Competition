# 2016-Competition
2016 Competition Robot Code

The 2016-Iterative project is the code on the robot

The 2016-IterativeEnum project is the code that uses enums rather than strings to identify states in the state machine, amoung other things

The 2016-IterativeBroken project is code that broke at worlds and we haven't tried to figure out why

The 2016-Competition project was the initial competition code, now it is not longer used


Yes, this was a messy year
